				"content_html": "<p>If you’ve noticed an increase recently, you’re not alone. Here’s a look behind the scenes at what’s driving these changes and what it means for us at Tico Coffee Roasters, and for you as a valued customer.</p>\n<p><strong>So, Why Are Coffee Prices Rising?</strong>\nThere’s no single reason for the current price hike, but several key factors are at play:\n<em>1. Brazil’s Struggles</em>\nBrazil, as the world’s largest coffee producer, has been facing severe weather challenges, including droughts and other disruptions. These conditions have drastically impacted their coffee harvests and, as a result, global supply has taken a hit.</p>\n<p><em>2. Climate Change is Affecting Crops</em>\nIn recent years, extreme weather events—whether it’s floods, droughts, or unpredictable temperatures—have become more common, and they’re making coffee production less predictable. It’s a global issue that’s impacting farmers everywhere, adding strain to the supply chain.</p>\n<p><em>3. Global Coffee Demand is Stronger Than Ever</em>\nEven with higher prices, the demand for coffee continues to climb. Coffee has become the go-to beverage for people all around the world, especially in emerging markets like Asia, South America, and Africa. This steady rise in consumption is adding more pressure to the limited supply available.</p>\n<p><em>4. Rising Costs Across the Supply Chain</em>\nIt’s not just about the beans themselves—transportation, labor, and other production costs have also gone up. From farm to cup, every step of the journey is becoming more expensive, and these increases contribute to the coffee price.</p>\n<p><strong>What Does This Mean for Us?</strong>\nAs a company committed to quality and sustainability, we want to assure you that we’re doing everything possible to navigate these challenges while still delivering the best coffee possible. Our relationships with farmers remain a top priority, and we continue to work closely with our partners to ensure they are supported, fairly compensated, and able to continue producing the exceptional coffee we all love.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Promise to You</strong>\nDespite the pressures we’re all facing, we at Tico Coffee Roasters are committed to maintaining the high standards that you’ve come to expect from us. We’re constantly evaluating how we can manage these rising costs without compromising the quality or integrity of our product.

The dark volcanic sand, calm waters, and stunning sunsets make it an ideal spot for swimming, sunbathing, and beachcombing. The beach is also a hub for various water sports, including snorkeling, scuba diving, fishing, and paddleboarding. The nearby Catalina Islands and Bat Islands offer some of the best diving spots in the region, teeming with marine life like rays, sharks, and colorful fish.\n\nAs the sun sets, Playas del Coco transforms into a lively hotspot with an array of bars, restaurants, and clubs. The town's vibrant nightlife attracts both locals and tourists, offering everything from relaxed beachfront bars to energetic dance clubs. Dining here is a treat, with numerous eateries serving up fresh seafood, traditional Costa Rican dishes, and international cuisine. One notable establishment is Mar Azul, a restaurant that has become a favorite for its exceptional seafood, warm ambiance, and impeccable service.\n\nBeyond the beach and nightlife, Playas del Coco is a gateway to numerous adventures and excursions. The surrounding area boasts lush rainforests, volcanic landscapes, and pristine national parks. A short drive away is the Rincon de la Vieja National Park, where visitors can hike through diverse ecosystems, see geothermal wonders, and spot wildlife like howler monkeys and tropical birds.\n\nFor those interested in marine life, boat tours, and fishing charters are readily available. These excursions offer the chance to see dolphins, sea turtles, and even humpback whales during their migration season. Sport fishing is particularly popular, with opportunities to catch marlin, sailfish, and roosterfish.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/playas-del-coco.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\">\n",
